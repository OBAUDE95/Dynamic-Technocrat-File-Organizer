The Dynamic Technocrat File Organizer is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simplify file management. It allows users to load a directory, automatically categorize files into predefined types (e.g., Images, Documents, Audio, Videos, Archives, Scripts, Executables, and Others), and generate a visual report of the file distribution.
